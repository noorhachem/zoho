# NOTE
The scripts in this folder are meant to support backward compatibility with the former version of the Zoho connector, which relies on a deprecated zoho API (v1.0). The zoho script contained in this folder exposes the same interface as the one defined by the zoho script of the preceding version. 
Note that you should not use former authentication technique but rather use OAuth.

*The scripts in the /lib folder are only meant to be used by applications leveraging the former version of the connector to maintain backward compatibiity. 
New applications should use /zoho*
